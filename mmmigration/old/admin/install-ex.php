I am from the UK. I first came with the intention to work and travel for a year, but I soon realised, that if I had the chance, then<br />\\r\\n	I would like to stay longer. Luckily, about half way through my visa, the Australian Government introduced new rules that if you worked for 3 months fruit picking on<br />\\r\\n	this visa, then you could extend your visa for another year. So, I decided this was what<br />\\r\\n	I had to do and worked for 3 months in QLD near Townsville - the work was labourious<br />\\r\\n	and not much fun, but it was a means to an end. This lead to me getting an extension to<br />\\r\\n	my 417 visa for another year, and I did some more travelling and working as I went,<br />\\r\\n	mostly in Sydney. I soon realised that I wanted to stay for longer in Sydney and<br />\\r\\n	fortunately in my last job before I had to return home, the company I was working for<br />\\r\\n	was keen to sponsor me, which led to me applying for and getting a 457 business visa which means you can work upto 4 years in Australia with some conditions though. After about 2 years, working on this visa, and a change of company, I decided that I wanted<br />\\r\\n	to be &#39;free&#39; and decided to look into the possibilities of applying for permanent residency<br />\\r\\n	so I wasnt sponsored by a company. This is when I first got in touch with Melanie at<br />\\r\\n	MMM, I found her details through a list of registered migration agents found online. I<br />\\r\\n	first met with Melanie in March of 2008, and after an initial consulatation, we got the ball rolling, having to collect a number of documents such as work references and academic transcripts etc. I had to have my skills assessed through a professional board and even take an English test which was booked up for a number of months. Once everything was<br />\\r\\n	in place, Melanie was able to lodge my application in July 2008. Then the waiting began and in December 2008,I was informed that I was assigned a case officer and that I<br />\\r\\n	should hear an outcome soon. In January 2009, I had the great news that I had got pre-approval for my visa and that all i had to do was leave the country and return to get<br />\\r\\n	my residency visa stamp, which i did in March 2009 - exactly 12 months from when i first met her.</p>\\r\\n<h3>\\r\\n	ZOE BLOOM - UK<br />\\r\\n	ENS sub-class 856 Employer sponsored permanent residence visa</h3>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n	I originally came to Melanie looking to apply for permanent residency individually.

Our new employee was identified from a referral to replace an employee that had amassed a great deal of expertise. The new employee had worked in a similar role in a firm of similar size under an existing 457 visa but wanted a change. We therefore thought it was just a simple case of transferring the employee from one sponsor to us, how silly to think it could be so simple. After downloading all the forms from the internet and trawling through them they were finally completed on 29 April 2009 and submitted to get RMG approved as a sponsor. Three requests for additional information, more fees and 9 weeks later we got approved on 6 July 2009. Now to get approval to sponsor the employee. More forms, more fees and endless emails ended in rejection on 10 August 2009. Along you came and took over the process and with minimal disruption, a reasonable fee and only 6 weeks we had our new employee at her desk on 1 October 2009. If there is to be a lesson learned from this it&#039;s that dealing with a government department is a mugs game and should be left to the professionals, By doing it ourselves we wasted valuable time, got very annoyed, nearly lost our new employee and spent more money than had we started with MMMigration up front. Thank you Melanie for saving us, I have no hesitation in recommending you.

We assist students within Australia to extend their visas and also apply for new student visas from offshore and onshore. The student visa program is one of the more complex of the visa programs with different Assessment levels and sub-classes according to the visa applicant’s country of origin, and particularly since the commencement of the student visa integrity program in August 2009 it is essential to seek the correct advice in order to ensure a successful outcome. Our education consultancy division, VETA Education Consultancy, can assist you with placements into colleges Australia wide. www.australiaveta.com.au To find out more info on studying in Australia click here Studying in Australia (English) Studying in Australia (Spanish) ONSHORE GENERAL SKILLED MIGRATION (485 AND 885) FOR THOSE STUDYING IN AUSTRALIA These days in Australia it is essential not to rely on simply the Points Test and skills assessments to gain the right to live and work here, but to apply the correct strategy which may even change during the course of the visa application. Overseas students in Australia are being strongly encouraged by the government not to see education as an automatic pathway to migration, however at MMMigration we pride ourselves in finding the right strategy to assist those students who have already studied in Australia and have the right skills to stay here. Please contact us for a free online assessment and further information about your eligibility for this program. EMPLOYER SPONSORSHIP RSMS, 457, ENS Our team of experts have been working with Australian companies, both in the cities and regional areas of the country, for many years and are familiar with all of the recent and ongoing changes to these types of visas. These are increasingly complex visas and it is vital to have the correct information before proceeding with any type of application for employer sponsorship, from both the company and the visa applicant’s perspective. Please contact us for a free online assessment and further information about your eligibility for this program. 457 – EMPLOYER TEMPORARY SPONSORSHIP Not only must the company be in a position to sponsor an overseas employee, offering appropriate training to its Australian employees, but it must also ensure that there really is a need within the company for the nominated position and that the visa applicant has the relevant skills and qualifications required for the position. Please contact us for a free online assessment and further information about your eligibility for this program. ENS Similarly the permanent version of the employer sponsored visa requires the employer to lodge a nomination for the position and subsequently a visa application for the permanent visa. Please contact us for a free online assessment and further information about your eligibility for this program. RSMS The process is somewhat different in that the employer needs to have the approval of a Regional Development Australia office prior to lodging the nomination and visa application with the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. Please contact us for a free online assessment and further information about your eligibility for this program.

Our new employee was identified from a referral to replace an employee that had amassed a great deal of expertise. The new employee had worked in a similar role in a firm of similar size under an existing 457 visa but wanted a change. We therefore thought it was just a simple case of transferring the employee from one sponsor to us, how silly to think it could be so simple. After downloading all the forms from the internet and trawling through them they were finally completed on 29 April 2009 and submitted to get RMG approved as a sponsor. Three requests for additional information, more fees and 9 weeks later we got approved on 6 July 2009. Now to get approval to sponsor the employee. More forms, more fees and endless emails ended in rejection on 10 August 2009. Along you came and took over the process and with minimal disruption, a reasonable fee and only 6 weeks we had our new employee at her desk on 1 October 2009. If there is to be a lesson learned from this it&#039;s that dealing with a government department is a mugs game and should be left to the professionals, By doing it ourselves we wasted valuable time, got very annoyed, nearly lost our new employee and spent more money than had we started with MMMigration up front. Thank you Melanie for saving us, I have no hesitation in recommending you.

PHILIP HEATH - UK 175 skilled independent migration visa From my first meeting with Melanie, I have found her immigration services to be first class and very professional and I would strongly recommend anyone interested in looking living in Australia to use MMM. I have been most impressed by the ease of the process, knowing that others have found it an extremely long and difficult process. I have had no problems along the way and any issues that I have raised have been answered in a timely and very accurate manner. I have had full faith and confidence from dealing with Melanie and she has done so in a friendly way, full of expertise and integrity. In relation to my own personal circumstances, I originally came to Australia back in December 2004 on a 417 working holiday visa (which many backpackers do), and I fell in love with the country, especially Sydney. I am from the UK. I first came with the intention to work and travel for a year, but I soon realised, that if I had the chance, then I would like to stay longer. Luckily, about half way through my visa, the Australian Government introduced new rules that if you worked for 3 months fruit picking on this visa, then you could extend your visa for another year. So, I decided this was what I had to do and worked for 3 months in QLD near Townsville - the work was labourious and not much fun, but it was a means to an end. This lead to me getting an extension to my 417 visa for another year, and I did some more travelling and working as I went, mostly in Sydney. I soon realised that I wanted to stay for longer in Sydney and fortunately in my last job before I had to return home, the company I was working for was keen to sponsor me, which led to me applying for and getting a 457 business visa which means you can work upto 4 years in Australia with some conditions though. After about 2 years, working on this visa, and a change of company, I decided that I wanted to be &#039;free&#039; and decided to look into the possibilities of applying for permanent residency so I wasnt sponsored by a company. This is when I first got in touch with Melanie at MMM, I found her details through a list of registered migration agents found online. I first met with Melanie in March of 2008, and after an initial consulatation, we got the ball rolling, having to collect a number of documents such as work references and academic transcripts etc. I had to have my skills assessed through a professional board and even take an English test which was booked up for a number of months. Once everything was in place, Melanie was able to lodge my application in July 2008. Then the waiting began and in December 2008,I was informed that I was assigned a case officer and that I should hear an outcome soon. In January 2009, I had the great news that I had got pre-approval for my visa and that all i had to do was leave the country and return to get my residency visa stamp, which i did in March 2009 - exactly 12 months from when i first met her. ZOE BLOOM - UK ENS sub-class 856 Employer sponsored permanent residence visa I originally came to Melanie looking to apply for permanent residency individually. At the time, I was on a business sponsorship visa with my employer. After meeting with Melanie, she encouraged me to apply for my visa through an Employment Nominated Visa. I was nervous about this option, as I was aware that my company didn&#039;t currently sponsor employees. Melanie assured me that this is the best option, kindly offered to email and correspond with my employer to highlight to her the benefits of the ENS Visa. Melanie worked closely with my employer, answering any queries she had and being patient with the time it took for her to hand over all the necessary documentation in order to lodge the application. She was also always helpful and supportive to me, and made me feel reassured that the visa would come through, and that everything would work out. My employer also found her extremely professional and wishes to use her business again in the future. She always answered &amp; responded to my many questions and concerns promptly, and was an absolute pleasure to work with! I am very grateful to her for the help she gave me to gain my permanent residency, and would recommend everyone to use her services! SEIL LEE - South Korea 457 employer sponsored temporary visa followed by ENS sub-class 856 employer sponsored permanent residence visa I&#039;m so excited to tell you, and greatful to say thank you very very much for the great outcome firstly but for your hard work. Obviously this is something that means just more than a sponsorship to me. I really didn&#039;t want to type this letter in a formal way because it doesn&#039;t sound genuine. So I wanted to say, thank you very much for everything. I truly think I&#039;m blessed with this outcome but I will definitely make it up to the people in need, through work (charities). This is truly a life changing moment for me, and thank you for giving me the opportunity for this to happen as well. JASON BOND - UK 457 employer sponsored temporary visa I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your friendliness and efficiency throughout the whole process. I was impressed with the way you took on board all the information I threw at you the first day we met and you have maintained this awareness throughout the whole process. It has been a pleasure to work with you and I will whole heartedly recommend your services to all. CAROLINE JOHNSON - UK 457 Our UK based Head Office had been using the services of a company within the UK to secure my Australian Visa (457) - after almost 8 months and a brush with immigration on re-entering Australia we switched to the services offered by Melanie and her team.     I would like to say that we were an easy client but I think this would be untrue, the stress of almost being deported due to a prior mix up on visas (nothing to do with mmmigration) and liaising with our UK directors made this a far from smooth process.    At various stages I really was in doubt that we would be successful given all the legal hoops.    To receive an email from Melanie on 20th March, which is under 4 months from when she took our case, advising they had been successful in securing my 457 for a period of 4 years was nothing short of incredible - I cannot recommend Melanie &amp; her team enough &amp; it is no small understatement to say that I will be eternally grateful.   Caroline Johnson, Asia Pacific Country Manager   Caroline Johnson  Sohnar Limited    RIZZA TIMBOL   Hi Melanie,   I’m back here on Hayman Island with Renzo and cannot thank you enough for your assistance.   I looking forward in dropping by and visiting when we come to Sydney so you can meet my son.   Thank you again and have a lovely evening.     Regards, Rizza   JOB SEEKING http://mmrecruitments.com.au CONTACT US /index.php?p=10 VIDEO TESTIMONIALS http://www.youtube.com/user/mmmigration #565EAA ');";
