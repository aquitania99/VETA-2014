	   We specialize in the following areas of visa application:<p></p>   

<h1>STUDENT VISAS (LINK TO VETA)</h1>

Highly specialized in student visas, our migration experts even give seminars to other migration agents about the student visa program.  We assist students within Australia to extend their visas and also apply for new student visas from offshore and onshore.  The student visa program is one of the more complex of the visa programs with different Assessment levels and sub-classes according to the visa applicant’s country of origin, and particularly since the commencement of the student visa integrity program in August 2009 it is essential to seek the correct advice in order to ensure a successful outcome.  

Our education consultancy division, VETA Education Consultancy, can assist you with placements into colleges Australia wide.

ONSHORE GENERAL SKILLED MIGRATION (485 AND 885) FOR THOSE STUDYING IN AUSTRALIA

These days in Australia it is essential not to rely on simply the Points Test and skills assessments to gain the right to live and work here, but to apply the correct strategy which may even change during the course of the visa application.  Overseas students in Australia are being strongly encouraged by the government not to see education as an automatic pathway to migration, however at MMMigration we pride ourselves in finding the right strategy to assist those students who have already studied in Australia and have the right skills to stay here.  

EMPLOYER SPONSORSHIP RSMS, 457, ENS

Our team of experts have been working with Australian companies, both in the cities and regional areas of the country, for many years and are familiar with all of the recent and ongoing changes to these types of visas.   These are increasingly complex visas and it is vital to have the correct information before proceeding with any type of application for employer sponsorship, from both the company and the visa applicant’s perspective.  

Please contact us for a free online assessment and further information about your eligibility for this program.  

457 – EMPLOYER TEMPORARY SPONSORSHIP

Not only must the company be in a position to sponsor an overseas employee, offering appropriate training to its Australian employees, but it must also ensure that there really is a need within the company for the nominated position and that the visa applicant has the relevant skills and qualifications required for the position.  

Please contact us for a free online assessment and further information about your eligibility for this program.  


ENS

Similarly the permanent version of the employer sponsored visa requires the employer to lodge a nomination for the position and subsequently a visa application for the permanent visa.  

Please contact us for a free online assessment and further information about your eligibility for this program.  


RSMS

The process is somewhat different in that the employer needs to have the approval of a Regional Development Australia office prior to lodging the nomination and visa application with the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. 

Please contact us for a free online assessment and further information about your eligibility for this program.  

FAMILY MIGRATION 

The Australian government allocates a certain number of places each year to family of Australian citizens and permanent residents.  

PARTNER VISAS 

In order to apply for this type of visa, it is necessary to fulfil the criteria of defacto relationship, which entails having lived together for 12 months prior to lodging an application, or to be married, and being able to demonstrate a genuine commitment to each other now and in the future.  

Please contact us for a free online assessment and further information about your eligibility for this program.  

PROVISIONAL SPOUSE VISAS

This visa, commonly referred to as the “fiancée visa”, gives the partners of Australian citizens or permanent residents the option to apply for a temporary visa to come to Australia with the purpose of marrying their partner within 9 months of arrival and then applying for the next stage of the partner visa application.  

Please contact us for a free online assessment and further information about your eligibility for this program.  


NEW ZEALAND PARTNER VISAS

This sub-class of visa allows partners of New Zealand citizens who are resident in Australia the option to apply for a 5 year partner visa without having to demonstrate the full 12 months of living together.  Once the 5 year limit is reached it is possible to renew this visa to have a further 5 years of residence in Australia.  This visa does not however grant the same rights as that of a permanent resident.  

Please contact us for a free online assessment and further information about your eligibility for this program.  

GENERAL SKILLED MIGRATION

Probably the part of the migration program that has changed the most in recent times, in keeping with the government’s philosophy of a demand driven skilled migration program, the changes are relentless, the most recent being the introduction of a new Skilled Occupations List on 1 July 2010 and a new Points Test on its way.  

Consequently it is essential to have a team of experts assess your suitability for this program and to create the right strategy for you to migrate successfully to Australia.
