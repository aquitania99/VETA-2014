<p>It is with great pleasure that I write to you about our experience using your services to obtain a 457 visa for a new staff member.</p>

<p>Our new employee was identified from a referral to replace an employee that had <br /> amassed a great deal of expertise. The new employee had worked in a similar role in <br /> a firm of similar size under an existing 457 visa but wanted a change. We therefore thought it was just a simple case of transferring the employee from one sponsor to us, <br /> how silly to think it could be so simple.</p>

<p>After downloading all the forms from the internet and trawling through them they were finally completed on 29 April 2009 and submitted to get RMG approved as a sponsor. Three requests for additional information, more fees and 9 weeks later we got approved on 6 July 2009.</p>

<p>Now to get approval to sponsor the employee. More forms, more fees and endless <br /> emails ended in rejection on 10 August 2009.</p>

<p>Along you came and took over the process and with minimal disruption, a reasonable <br /> fee and only 6 weeks we had our new employee at her desk on 1 October 2009.</p>

<p>If there is to be a lesson learned from this it's that dealing with a government department <br /> is a mugs game and should be left to the professionals, By doing it ourselves we wasted valuable time, got very annoyed, nearly lost our new employee and spent more money than had we started with MMMigration up front.</p>

<p>Thank you Melanie for saving us, I have no hesitation in recommending you.

<p>I would like to thank you for all your help regarding my Occupational Trainee visa application.The internship opportunity with the voysages Ayers rock resort helped me <br /> a lot to improve my skills in the hospitality business,it also helped me to gain a hands on experience with a touch of leadership skills.</p>

<h1>PHILIP HEATH</h1>
<p>From my first meeting with Melanie, I have found her immigration services to be first  <br /> class and very professional and I would strongly recommend anyone interested in <br /> looking living in Australia to use MMM. I have been most impressed by the ease of <br /> the process, knowing that others have found it an extremely long and difficult process. <br /> I have had no problems along the way and any issues that I have raised have been answered in a timely and very accurate manner. I have had full faith and confidence <br /> from dealing with Melanie and she has done so in a friendly way, full of expertise and integrity. </p>
 
<p>In relation to my own personal circumstances, I originally came to Australia back in December 2004 on a 417 working holiday visa (which many backpackers do), and I <br /> fell in love with the country, especially Sydney. I am from the UK. I first came with the intention to work and travel for a year, but I soon realised, that if I had the chance, then <br /> I would like to stay longer. Luckily, about half way through my visa, the Australian Government introduced new rules that if you worked for 3 months fruit picking on <br /> this visa, then you could extend your visa for another year. So, I decided this was what <br /> I had to do and worked for 3 months in QLD near Townsville - the work was labourious <br /> and not much fun, but it was a means to an end. This lead to me getting an extension to <br /> my 417 visa for another year, and I did some more travelling and working as I went, <br /> mostly in Sydney. I soon realised that I wanted to stay for longer in Sydney and <br /> fortunately in my last job before I had to return home, the company I was working for <br /> was keen to sponsor me, which led to me applying for and getting a 457 business visa which means you can work upto 4 years in Australia with some conditions though. After about 2 years, working on this visa, and a change of company, I decided that I wanted <br /> to be 'free' and decided to look into the possibilities of applying for permanent residency <br /> so I wasnt sponsored by a company. This is when I first got in touch with Melanie at <br /> MMM, I found her details through a list of registered migration agents found online. I <br /> first met with Melanie in March of 2008, and after an initial consulatation, we got the ball rolling, having to collect a number of documents such as work references and academic transcripts etc. I had to have my skills assessed through a professional board and even take an English test which was booked up for a number of months. Once everything was <br /> in place, Melanie was able to lodge my application in July 2008. Then the waiting began and in December 2008,I was informed that I was assigned a case officer and that I <br /> should hear an outcome soon. In January 2009, I had the great news that I had got pre-approval for my visa and that all i had to do was leave the country and return to get <br /> my residency visa stamp, which i did in March 2009 - exactly 12 months from when i first met her.</p>

<h1>ZOE BLOOM</h1>
<p>I originally came to Melanie looking to apply for permanent residency individually. At the time, I was on a business sponsorship visa with my employer. After meeting with Melanie, she encouraged me to apply for my visa through an Employment Nominated Visa. I was nervous about this option, as I was aware that my company didn't currently sponsor employees. Melanie assured me that this is the best option, kindly offered to email and correspond with my employer to highlight to her the benefits of the ENS Visa.</p>

<p>Melanie worked closely with my employer, answering any queries she had and being patient with the time it took for her to hand over all the necessary documentation in <br /> order to lodge the application. She was also always helpful and supportive to me, and made me feel reassured that the visa would come through, and that everything would <br /> work out. My employer also found her extremely professional and wishes to use her business again in the future. She always answered & responded to my many questions <br /> and concerns promptly, and was an absolute pleasure to work with! I am very grateful to her for the help she gave me to gain my permanent residency, and would recommend everyone to use her services!</p>

<h1>SEIL LEE</h1>
<p>I'm so excited to tell you, and greatful to say thank you very very much for the great outcome firstly but for your hard work. Obviously this is something that means just more than a sponsorship to me. I really didn't want to type this letter in a formal way because it doesn't sound genuine. So I wanted to say, thank you very much for everything. I truly <br /> think I'm blessed with this outcome but I will definitely make it up to the people in need, through work (charities). This is truly a life changing moment for me, and thank you for giving me the opportunity for this to happen as well.</p>

<h1>JASON BOND</h1>
<p>I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your friendliness and  efficiency throughout the whole process. I was impressed with the way you took on board all the information I threw at you the first day we met and you have maintained this awareness throughout the whole process. It has been a pleasure to work with you and I will whole heartedly recommend your services to all.</p>
